# trash_films

## About

A simple web app developed using the railz_lite framework. https://github.com/bryanqb07/railz_lite

Dedicated to my love of bad films, it serves as a directory for trash films where anyone can come and leave a review.

## Getting Started

To get started: clone the repo with 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/bryanqb07/trash_films.git
```

After running bundle install, start the railz_lite server
```
$ cd trash_films
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec railz_lite server
```

The app should appear on localhost:3000
